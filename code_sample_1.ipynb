    "This is a complex SQL query that aggregates television viewing data from a source table, ext_data_stream.inscape_content_data, and classifies households based on their viewing patterns. The query has multiple Common Table Expressions (CTEs) to break down the problem into smaller steps. Here's a breakdown of the query:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The first CTE named content aggregates the source data by year, month, week number, day, household, and TV ID. It calculates the total content duration in hours for each household and the number of events (or occurrences of content playback).\n",
    "2. The second CTE named temp_table uses the content CTE to calculate percentiles for the total content duration for households across weeks. The percentiles are used later to classify households based on their viewing patterns.\n",
    "3. The third CTE named viewership_table joins the temp_table and content CTEs and calculates the household viewing classification based on the total content duration, distinct TV count, and percentiles from temp_table.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, the query performs a series of aggregations on the source data to classify households based on their viewing patterns. It calculates the total content duration, distinct TV count, and other metrics at various levels of granularity, including year, month, week, and household. Finally, it uses percentiles to assign households to one of four classes: light, medium, heavy, and heavy plus.\n",
